				<p style="width: 80vw; padding-right: 20px;">Playing amiable indie pop/rock with an alternative edge, 
					biting wit, and a jazzy sense of sophistication, Canada's Mother Mother rose to national prominence 
					in the early 2010s bolstered by the enigmatic presence of siblings Ryan (vocals, guitar) and Molly Guldemond 
					(vocals, keyboards).The quintet rode a series of indie successes to a Top Ten chart placement with 
					their acclaimed 2011 album, EUREKA.
